Nothing better than portabioity when it comes to data. For fliyng comps [Airtribune](https://airtribune.com/) provides realtime tracking, sameas [Flymaster](https://www.flymaster.net/).
However, for the 2018 HG comps the livetracking and reviewing of past tasks was horrible. Thus, I implemented a track viewer using OpenLaters, which allows direct reading of IGC files.

I implemented a view of all waypoints for both [Cowboy Up](http://www.cuhanggliding.com) and the [Green Swamp Sport Classic](https://airtribune.com/2019-green-swamp-sport-klassic/info).
