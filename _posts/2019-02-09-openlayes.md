Nothing better than portability when it comes to data. For flying comps [Airtribune](https://airtribune.com/) provides realtime tracking, same as [Flymaster](https://www.flymaster.net/), and many others.
However, for the 2018 HG comps the livetracking and reviewing of past tasks was horrible. Thus, I implemented a track viewer using [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/), which allows direct reading of IGC files.

There is view of all waypoints for both [Cowboy Up](http://www.cuhanggliding.com) and the [Green Swamp Sport Classic](https://airtribune.com/2019-green-swamp-sport-klassic/info), which can be used for task development.

[GSSK Waypoints](https://f0n.github.io/GSSK/waypoints)

My favorite part of OpenLayers is to be able to view IGC files. Thus, I can superimpose the task and the track, similarly to what [Airtribune](https://airtribune.com/) shows. Obviously a work in development as I need to add player capability, ensure the projections are correct, and ultimately live tracking. But for now, open source software for hang gliding flight tracking paint a right picture.
