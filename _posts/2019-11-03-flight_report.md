I had not been able to fly since Big Spring (more than 2 months), and I could recall Mick's words saying to fly no later than 1 weel after the Comp to keep the muscle memory. Unfortunately, things hadn't lined up until today. Weather called for calm winds from the SE and not much activity. My goal would be to focus on good takeoffs and landings. 

I got to Wharton at ~1:00 PM and Efrain, Read, Henry and Carl were getting set up. Right away I started setting up, but took my time intentioally to ensure that the glider had not been damaged during transport. Big Spring can be a hard place for dust and the prikclies (Texas Burrs), plus car transport, and having the glider stored at home since then.

Everything checked out on the glider, equipment, etc. It was time to go. Henry, Carl and Read were in the air already as my turn came. Tiki spent some time helping me adjust the hang loop. All systems go, and off we went on tow. This tow felt so good. I guess not so rowdy of an air, lower altitude, and the confidence gained allowed me to enjoy this tow so much more than ever before. 

After release there wasn't much lift, so I just practiced turns, drawing a course on the ground, changing speeds, etc. Then, onto final and landing. Keeping speed up to ground effect, and a nice soft flare. I decided to jog the glider back to the launch line to both have some more exercise and to reminice of the learning days at the training hill. 

This went on for three flights. Good consistent launches and landings... hopefully with some added XC miles next time.
